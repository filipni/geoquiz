# GeoQuiz!
This is my attempt at some front-end web development. A cute app that can help you memorize capitals and flags of different countries around the world. No fancy libraries were used when making this, only HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

You can find a live version of the app [here](https://filipni.github.io/geoquiz/).
